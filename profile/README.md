## Hi there 👋

Welcome to heaven ☁️

**Here are some words:**

 - 🙋‍♀️ A short glimpse - I created this organization to manage some of my personal as well as public repos efficiently.
 - 🌈 Contribution guidelines - Write neat code. add a space after = or comment. Use space or tabs, really doesn't matter.
 - 👩‍💻 Useful resources - read the docs
 - 🍿 Fun facts - A crocodile cannot stick its tongue out.
 - 🍿 Fun facts 2 - You didn't expected that, did you?
 - 🍿❌ Non-Fun facts - I have ADHD
 - 🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

But on a serious note-- I love open-source and I'm trying my best to move the community further ❤️
